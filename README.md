# Hotel Dashboard Project
* Using a database on hotels that I found I wanted to look into PowerBi and see if it was more intuitive for me that Tableau

# Goals of the Dashboard
* Find out if the revenue of the hotels were growing by year. 
* Filter these trends by hotel type, countries and year.
* Provide a simple header that shows basic live info such as Total Revenue and ADR (average daily rate).
* Give the audience multiple different types of visualizations that explore different parts of the same data.
* Find out if more guests are bringing their own vehicles, creating a need for more parking spaces.
